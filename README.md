# deal-intel-mcp

**English** | [한국어](README.ko.md)

A B2B sales-support MCP server: paste a meeting note and it scores the deal on MEDDPICC, then stacks everything in MongoDB to surface which deals are stuck and where you're losing.

Drive it by talking — in Claude Desktop, or in Codex with the MCP connected. No separate CRM app.

---

## Live demo

Two ways to look at the deal data you've accumulated.

### 1. MongoDB Atlas Charts — Weekly Pipeline Review

![Atlas Charts Weekly Pipeline Review dashboard](docs/images/atlas-dashboard.png)

Active/Attention deal counts, pipeline value by stage, MEDDPICC health-band distribution, gap distribution, and open pipeline value — all on one screen. Each chart's aggregation pipeline is generated with the `render-atlas-dashboard` CLI and pasted into Atlas Charts (see the "Atlas Charts Dashboard" section below).

### 2. Claude / Codex in-chat rendered analysis

![Claude in-chat rendered dashboard](docs/images/chat-dashboard.png)

It takes the raw MCP tool output and renders win rate, the stage funnel, Won vs Lost MEDDPICC gaps, data-quality coverage, and attention items right inside the conversation. It all starts from pasting in a single meeting note — no extra app.

> Company names and figures in these screens are all fictional demo data.

---

## What is this?

**MEDDPICC** is a deal-qualification framework used in B2B sales. It scores "is this customer actually likely to buy?" across seven dimensions.

| Dimension | What it measures |
|---|---|
| **M**etrics | The quantified impact the customer expects (ROI, cost-reduction %) |
| **E**conomic Buyer | Who actually holds budget authority |
| **D**ecision Criteria | What the vendor-selection criteria are |
| **D**ecision Process | How the internal approval process runs |
| **I**dentify Pain | The customer's core problem and its urgency |
| **C**hampion | Whether you have an internal advocate |
| **C**ompetition | How you fight competitors and the status quo |

Paste a meeting note and the LLM extracts these seven automatically, stacks them in MongoDB Atlas, and runs pattern analysis on top.

## Install (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- Claude Desktop (Windows / Mac)
- Python 3.11+ with `pip install -e .` completed in a conda env
- A MongoDB Atlas account (the free M0 cluster is enough)
- A ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription **or** an Anthropic API key

### Steps

**Step 1 — Install the package**

```bash
# reuse the event-intel conda env
~/miniconda3/envs/event-intel/python.exe -m pip install -e ".[embedding]"
```

Adding `[embedding]` also installs `sentence-transformers` (for similar-deal search).

**Step 2 — Configure .env**

Copy `.env.example` in the project root to `.env` and fill it in.

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # leave blank if using ChatGPT OAuth
```

**Step 3 — Install the mcpb bundle**

Double-click `deal-intel-mcp-0.1.5.mcpb` (built from `mcpb/manifest.json`), or install via Claude Desktop → Settings → Extensions → from file. See [`mcpb/README.md`](mcpb/README.md) for how to build the bundle.

The form that appears:
- **MongoDB Atlas URI** — paste the URI you set above
- **Use ChatGPT Plus/Pro** — checked by default; leave it if using ChatGPT OAuth
- **Anthropic API key** — enter if using Anthropic; leave blank for ChatGPT OAuth

**Step 4 — ChatGPT OAuth login** (ChatGPT subscribers only)

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/event-intel/python.exe -m deal_intel.cli login-chatgpt
```

A browser opens; log in with your ChatGPT account. One time only.

**Step 5 — Restart Claude Desktop**

You're done when these 13 tools appear in the tool list.

```
create_deal / add_meeting / get_deal / update_stage / update_deal
list_deals / get_metrics / get_deal_gaps / get_insights / get_customer_themes
export_report / analyze_deal / search_deals
```

## Tool guide (13 tools)

> **Tip**: In Claude Desktop, type the example sentences below verbatim or say something similar. You can find a `deal_id` with `create_deal` or `list_deals`.

---

### 1. `create_deal` — create a new deal

**When to use**: Run this first when you start engaging a new prospect.

**Example**:
```
Create a new deal for Hyundai Precision. Manufacturing industry, deal size 200M KRW.
```

**Parameters**:
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `company` | required | Customer company name |
| `industry` | optional | Industry (e.g., "Manufacturing", "IT SaaS") |
| `deal_size_krw` | optional | Median expected contract size (in KRW, e.g., 200000000) |
| `deal_size_status` | required when an amount is given | Amount status: `unknown`, `rough_estimate`, `customer_budget`, `quoted`, `strategic_zero` |
| `deal_size_low_krw` / `deal_size_high_krw` | optional | Estimate range. Omitted → treated as equal to the median in metrics |
| `deal_size_note` | optional | Rationale for the amount classification, or a user memo |
| `expected_close_date` | optional | Expected close date. Omitted → config default applies |

**Example result**:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "deal_id": "a3f9...",
  "company": "Hyundai Precision",
  "deal_size_krw": 200000000,
  "deal_size_status": "rough_estimate",
  "expected_close_date": "2026-06-15",
  "expected_close_date_source": "config_default"
}
```

Remember this `deal_id`, or look it up later with `list_deals`.

If you omit the expected close date, a default of 7 days after creation is filled in. This is an operational default, not a confirmed schedule. A date you provide always takes precedence over config.

When you enter a deal amount, you must also set its status. If unknown, leave `deal_size_status="unknown"` and leave the amount blank. If only a positive amount is given, the tool asks which basis applies — sales estimate / customer budget / quote sent. If only 0 is given, it doesn't save immediately and asks whether it's a strategic free/reference deal or an undecided amount. If undecided, it's saved as `unknown` with the amount blanked. An intentional zero-KRW deal (free sample, reference win) is saved with `deal_size_krw=0` and `deal_size_status="strategic_zero"`. If you heard a customer budget or sent a quote, use `customer_budget` or `quoted` so it counts as a validated pipeline value in metrics.

```yaml
pipeline:
  expected_close:
    default_days: 7
    days_by_industry:
      공공: 60
      대기업: 28

reporting:
  timezone: Asia/Seoul
```

Industry overrides apply on a case-insensitive exact match against the free-form `industry` value. Auto-dates use the business date in the reporting timezone, while stored audit timestamps stay in UTC.

---

### 2. `add_meeting` — add a meeting note

**When to use**: Right after a customer meeting. Paste the note as-is and the LLM extracts MEDDPICC automatically.

**Example**:
```
Add today's (2026-06-08) meeting note to Hyundai Precision, deal_id: a3f9...

Notes:
Met Director Kim (purchasing decision-maker). Current production-line defect rate
is 3.2%, causing ~1.5B KRW/yr loss. Our solution targets ≤1.5%. Manager Park is in
favor internally. Competitor A is under review but costs 2x. Internal approval due
end of June.
```

**Parameters**:
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `deal_id` | required | Target deal ID |
| `date` | required | Meeting date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `raw_notes` | required | Raw meeting notes (Korean or English both fine) |

**What the result includes**:
- `meddpicc` — scores + evidence extracted from this meeting
- `meddpicc_latest` — the deal's cumulative health_pct + per-dimension trend
- `summary` — a 2–3 sentence LLM-generated summary
- `customer_themes` — customer concerns / selection criteria extracted from this meeting
- `stage_suggestion` — filled only when the notes explicitly imply a stage transition (e.g., contract signed → won, lost deal → lost); otherwise `null`
- `embedding_stored` — whether the similar-deal-search embedding was stored

> **The stage never changes automatically.** Even if the notes say "contract signed," `add_meeting` does not change the stage directly — it only **suggests** via `stage_suggestion`. When Claude asks "shall I move this deal to won?", `update_stage` makes the actual change after you confirm. This is a deliberate separation to prevent wrong auto-closing.

---

### 3. `get_deal` — view deal details

**When to use**: To check a specific deal's full history, MEDDPICC scores, and meeting records.

**Example**:
```
Show me the full Hyundai Precision deal. deal_id is a3f9...
```

You get the raw notes, the per-meeting MEDDPICC extraction, and the cumulative health_pct.

---

### 4. `update_stage` — change the pipeline stage

**When to use**: When a deal moves to the next stage or the outcome is finalized.

```text
update_stage(deal_id, new_stage, actual_close_date="")
```

**Example**:
```
Move the Hyundai Precision deal to the proposal stage.
```

When moving to `won` or `lost`, you can specify the actual close date as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Omitted → the processing day is stored. `expected_close_date` stays as the forecast, and `stage_history.entered_at` is the system audit time, kept distinct from the actual close date. Moving a closed deal back to an open stage clears `actual_close_date`.

**Stages** (in order):
```
discovery → qualification → proposal → negotiation → won / lost / stalled
```

**What the result includes**:
- `actual_close_date` — the real close date for Won/Lost
- `days_in_previous_stage` — how long it spent in the previous stage
- `stuck_threshold_days` — the stuck threshold for a new Active stage; otherwise `null`
- MEDDPICC gaps are recomputed per stage (e.g., a drop in Identify Pain at the proposal stage is not a gap — it's a positive signal that the pain is being resolved)

---

### 5. `update_deal` — fix an existing deal's amount classification

**When to use**: When an existing deal's `deal_size_status` is missing, or to save after the user confirms customer-budget / quote / strategic-zero.

The first version only edits deal-value fields, for safety. It does not touch company, industry, stage, meetings, or contacts.

**Example**:
```
The existing ArcanaGames deal has evidence of a closed contract, so save it as quoted.
Note the rationale as "CEO said let's sign today and paid same-day."
```

**Required conditions**:
- `confirmed_by_user=true`
- `deal_size_note` with the user's confirmation rationale or meeting evidence

Edits are logged to `deal_value_history`.

---

### 6. `list_deals` — see all deals at a glance

**When to use**: When you want the whole pipeline at a glance. Good for a weekly review.

**Example**:
```
Show me all deals, stuck ones first.
```

Or a specific stage only:
```
Show me only the deals in the proposal stage.
```

**Result**:
- `health_pct` — overall MEDDPICC score (0–100)
- `gaps` — list of weak, low-scoring dimensions
- `is_stuck` — whether the Active-stage dwell time exceeds the per-stage threshold
- `is_overdue` / `overdue_days` — whether an Open deal passed its expected close date
- `attention_reasons` — multiple reasons: `stalled`, `overdue`, `stuck`, `at_risk`
- `days_in_stage` — days spent in the current stage
- `data_quality` — per-deal missing/invalid/estimated fields and overall coverage
- `as_of`, `timezone`, `generated_at` — reporting base date and generation time

Specify `as_of="YYYY-MM-DD"` to re-run date-based calculations against the same base date. Stuck deals sort to the top.

---

### 7. `analyze_deal` — MEDDPICC gap analysis + BD strategy

**When to use**: When a deal is stuck or you're planning the next meeting. The LLM analyzes gaps and proposes concrete actions.

**Example**:
```
Analyze the Hyundai Precision deal. Where is it weak, and what should I do next meeting?
```

The result includes:
- a summary of current MEDDPICC health
- concrete responses per weak dimension
- a recommended agenda for the next meeting

---

### 8. `get_metrics` — current pipeline-health KPIs

**When to use**: For instant BI questions in Claude/Codex like "how's pipeline health right now?", "how many at-risk deals?", "show pipeline value and health by stage."

The first version supports only `pipeline_health`.

**Parameters**:
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `metric_type` | optional | Currently only `pipeline_health` |
| `stage` | optional | Exact match against the stored stage |
| `industry` | optional | Exact match against the stored industry |
| `as_of` | optional | Base date for stuck/overdue calculation, `YYYY-MM-DD` |

**What the result includes**:
- `kpis`: active/open/stalled/terminal count, open value, avg health, coverage, stuck/overdue, attention count
- `stage_breakdown`: count/value/health/stuck/overdue in canonical stage order
- `health_bands`: healthy/watch/at_risk/unassessed counts
- `attention_reasons`: stalled/overdue/stuck/at_risk reason counts and unique attention-deal count
- `pipeline_values`, `win_rate`, `data_quality`, `warnings`

The BI path uses no LLM and no embedding. Raw notes, contacts, and vectors are excluded from the metric read path.

**Example**:
```
Tell me the current pipeline health
```
```
Show pipeline health for the proposal stage only
```
```
Show stuck/overdue status for IT-industry deals
```

---

### 9. `get_deal_gaps` — find missing customer-attack information

**When to use**: When you want to know what you still need to confirm before pursuing, forecasting, or reviewing a deal.

This is not a table-completeness checker. It prioritizes missing or weak information by practical sales impact and forecast trust. It is read-only, uses no LLM, uses no embedding, and excludes raw notes, contacts, and vectors.

**Parameters**:
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `as_of` | optional | Base date for stuck/overdue calculation, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `stage` | optional | Exact match against the stored stage |
| `industry` | optional | Exact match against the stored industry |
| `deal_id` | optional | Exact deal id. Returns that deal regardless of `min_priority` and `limit` |
| `min_priority` | optional | `low`, `medium`, or `high`. Defaults to `medium` |
| `limit` | optional | 1 to 50. Defaults to 10 |

**What the result includes**:
- `summary`: deal count, gap-deal count, priority counts, gap status/type counts
- `deals`: prioritized deals with health band, attention reasons, priority score, and gaps
- each gap includes reason, suggested question, and recommended action

**Example**:
```
What important customer information are we missing for active deals?
```
```
Show high-priority gaps for negotiation deals
```
```
For this deal_id, what should I confirm next?
```

---

### 10. `export_report` — generate a weekly pipeline report

**When to use**: When you need a file to share or for a meeting, like "make this week's pipeline report."

The first version supports only `weekly_pipeline` and produces CSV and Markdown with the same timestamp.

**Parameters**:
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `report_type` | optional | Currently only `weekly_pipeline` |
| `output_dir` | optional | Save path. Omitted → `reporting.output_dir` or `outputs/reports` |
| `stage` | optional | Exact match against the stored stage |
| `industry` | optional | Exact match against the stored industry |
| `as_of` | optional | Base date for stuck/overdue calculation, `YYYY-MM-DD` |

**What the result includes**:
- `csv_path`, `markdown_path`: absolute paths of the generated files
- `artifacts`: CSV/Markdown filename, path, encoding
- `metrics`, `warnings`, `row_count`

This is a BI/Reporting path, so it uses no LLM and no embedding.

**Example**:
```
Make this week's pipeline report
```
```
Export the proposal stage only as a weekly pipeline report
```

---

### Atlas Charts Dashboard — `Weekly Pipeline Review`

When you'd rather see it on screen than as CSV/Markdown, use the Atlas Charts dashboard. The dashboard aggregation spec and setup runbook are in [`docs/atlas-charts.md`](docs/atlas-charts.md).

Render command:

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/event-intel/python.exe -m deal_intel.cli render-atlas-dashboard --as-of 2026-06-09 --output outputs/atlas_charts/weekly_pipeline_review_20260609.json
```

To paste a single chart into the Atlas Query bar:

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/event-intel/python.exe -m deal_intel.cli render-atlas-dashboard --as-of 2026-06-09 --chart-id pipeline_kpis
```

The five managed chart ids are `pipeline_kpis`, `stage_breakdown`, `health_bands`, `attention_deals`, `meddpicc_gap_distribution`.

Cross-check the dashboard numbers:

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/event-intel/python.exe -m deal_intel.cli crosscheck-weekly-dashboard --as-of 2026-06-09 --output-dir outputs/m3_3_crosscheck
```

---

### 11. `get_insights` — pipeline BI analysis

**When to use**: To aggregate all deal data and spot patterns. Good for monthly reviews and learning win/loss patterns.

You can specify `as_of`; the response includes `timezone` and a UTC `generated_at`. These label the current collection snapshot — they don't reconstruct historical document state.

**Seven analysis types**:

| query_type | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `pipeline_overview` | Deal count / avg health / total size by stage |
| `win_patterns` | Average MEDDPICC scores of Won deals |
| `loss_patterns` | Average MEDDPICC scores of Lost deals |
| `compare_won_lost` | Per-dimension score gap between Won and Lost |
| `gap_frequency` | The dimensions most often missing in active deals |
| `industry_benchmark` | Avg health / win rate / deal size by industry |
| `stage_velocity` | Average dwell days per stage |

**Example**:
```
Show me the whole pipeline overview.
```
```
What's the MEDDPICC pattern difference between deals we win and deals we lose?
```
```
Which dimension is most often missing?
```

---

### 11. `search_deals` — semantic similar-deal search

**When to use**: When you want to reference how past deals in similar situations played out. Search in natural language.

**Example**:
```
Find deals where the customer struggled with cost reduction.
```
```
Show deals with a strong champion and a clear decision structure.
```
```
Any deals with a pattern similar to Hyundai Precision?
```

**How it works**:
1. Convert the query into a 384-dim vector
2. Compute cosine similarity against every deal's meeting-summary vector
3. Return them sorted by similarity, highest first

**What the result includes**:
- `score` — similarity (0–1, higher = more similar)
- `deal_stage`, `health_pct`, `gaps` — the deal's current state

> The local embedding model warms up in the background at server start. While it's loading, `warming_up: true` is returned, so retry after 5 seconds. After 30+ seconds it switches to a stalled error.

---

### 12. `get_customer_themes` — frequency of customer concerns / selection criteria

**When to use**: To group meeting evidence across deals and see the topics customers worry about most. It counts by unique deal (not by meeting) and returns representative companies and evidence.

**Example**:
```
Show the top 5 things customers worried about most across active deals.
```
```
Tell me the most frequent themes and evidence in Decision Criteria.
```

**Filters**:
- `dimension`: `all`, `identify_pain`, `decision_criteria`, `metrics`
- `stage`: `active`, `all`, or an individual deal stage
- `industry`: exact industry name
- `top_k`: up to 20

To backfill themes onto existing data, run this first:

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/event-intel/python.exe -m deal_intel.cli backfill-customer-themes --apply
```

The Atlas Charts aggregation is in `scripts/atlas_charts_customer_themes.json`.

---

## Recommended workflow

```
1. Right after a meeting  → add_meeting (paste the note)
2. On stage change        → update_stage
3. Pre-meeting prep        → analyze_deal (figure out the next agenda)
4. Weekly review           → list_deals (find stuck deals)
5. Pipeline KPIs           → get_metrics pipeline_health
6. Monthly retro           → get_insights compare_won_lost / stage_velocity
7. Reference similar cases → search_deals
8. Customer-concern analysis → get_customer_themes
9. Dashboard               → Atlas Charts Weekly Pipeline Review
```

### How MEDDPICC health_pct is computed

```
health_pct = sum(dim_avg × weight) / sum(5 × weight) × 100
```

Weights (tunable in `config/defaults.yaml`):

| Dimension | Weight | Why |
|---|---|---|
| champion | 2.0 | No internal momentum → no deal |
| identify_pain / economic_buyer | 1.5 | Confirming the pain and reaching the budget holder are core |
| metrics / decision_criteria / decision_process | 1.0 | Standard |
| competition | 0.5 | Competition surfacing late is normal |

**Stage-aware gap adjustment** (applied automatically on `update_stage`):
- A drop in Identify Pain at the `proposal` / `negotiation` stage → not a gap (signals the pain is being resolved)
- `won` deals → no gaps

**Health-band configuration**:

Defaults are Healthy ≥70, Watch ≥40, At Risk <40. These classify the level of MEDDPICC validation, not win probability, and can be changed in `~/.deal-intel/config.yaml` once you've accumulated operational data.

```yaml
metrics:
  health_bands:
    healthy_min: 75
    watch_min: 45
  overdue:
    grace_days: 0
  win_rate:
    minimum_closed_sample: 10
```

The formal definitions of Active/Open/Stalled and unassessed handling are in [`docs/metrics.md`](docs/metrics.md).

## FAQ

**Q. Do my meeting notes have to be perfect?**
No. A rough memo of the essentials is fine. The LLM just skips dimensions with no evidence.

**Q. Do Korean meeting notes work?**
Yes. Mixed English/Korean works too.

**Q. Do I need a paid MongoDB Atlas plan?**
The core features work on the free M0 plan today. `search_deals` computes with Python cosine on M0. As deal volume grows you can switch to Atlas Vector Search on M10+.

**Q. search_deals returns nothing.**
