Extract MEDDPICC qualification signals from the meeting notes below.

For each MEDDPICC dimension present in the notes, return:
- score: 0-5  (0=absent, 1=weak mention, 3=moderate signal, 5=confirmed/strong)
- evidence: direct quote or close paraphrase from the notes

MEDDPICC dimensions:
- metrics: Quantifiable business impact, ROI, or success criteria
- economic_buyer: Decision-maker identity, authority level, and access
- decision_criteria: Formal or informal selection requirements
- decision_process: Procurement, approval, or timeline steps
- identify_pain: Core business problem, severity, and urgency
- champion: Internal advocate — name, position, commitment level
- competition: Competing vendors, alternatives, or status quo

Also extract 0-5 customer concern themes grounded only in identify_pain,
decision_criteria, or metrics evidence. Choose theme_key only from:
{theme_catalog}

For each customer theme return:
- theme_key
- dimension: identify_pain | decision_criteria | metrics
- evidence: direct quote or close paraphrase
- importance: 1-5, where 5 means explicitly critical or deal-breaking

Also detect whether the notes EXPLICITLY indicate a pipeline stage change.
Only emit "stage_signal" when there is direct evidence of a transition, e.g.:
- contract signed / PO issued / final selection won  → won
- deal rejected, lost to a competitor, or budget cut → lost
- project frozen / put on hold indefinitely          → stalled
- formal proposal or quote sent                       → proposal
- pricing/terms being negotiated                      → negotiation
When the notes do not clearly imply a transition, OMIT stage_signal entirely.
This is only a suggestion — never assume the stage has already changed.

stage_signal fields:
- suggested_stage: discovery | qualification | proposal | negotiation | won | lost | stalled
- confidence: high | medium | low
- evidence: direct quote or close paraphrase justifying the change

Omit MEDDPICC dimensions with no evidence. Do not infer unstated themes.
Return valid JSON only — no prose, no markdown fences.

Example output:
{{
  "meddpicc": {{
    "metrics": {{"score": 3, "evidence": "CFO wants 20% cost reduction by Q3"}},
    "identify_pain": {{"score": 4, "evidence": "Current system crashes weekly"}}
