### Recruit AI bootstrap roadmap

Goal: turn the inherited `deal-intel-mcp` codebase into `recruit-ai-mcp`, a
recruiter/search-firm intelligence layer for client companies, open positions,
candidates, submissions, feedback, interactions, recommendation runs, metrics,
reports, and safe local/sample onboarding.

Current positioning:

- `full` is the default real-data path for MongoDB-backed recruiting records in
  `recruit_ai`; `sample` remains the zero-config evaluation path.
- Atlas Free/M0 stays on deterministic Python cosine / lexical retrieval.
  Atlas Vector Search belongs only to the paid `pro` path after the user
  intentionally moves to M10+ infrastructure.
- Python package imports intentionally remain under `deal_intel` during the
  staged cutover. Public metadata, CLI alias, env prefix, local paths, MCPB
  copy, MongoDB defaults, and current docs should present `recruit-ai-mcp`,
  `recruit-ai`, `RECRUIT_AI_*`, and `~/.recruit-ai`.
- Inherited deal-intelligence tools remain compatibility surfaces. Current
  user-facing first-run guidance should lead with recruiting tools:
  `create_client_company`, `create_position`, `create_candidate`,
  `add_recruiting_interaction`, `add_client_feedback`,
  `recommend_candidates_for_position`, `recommend_positions_for_candidate`,
  `get_recruiting_metrics`, and `export_recruiting_report`.

Current completed baseline:

- Work 0 isolation is implemented for public package metadata, CLI aliases,
  config paths, env precedence, local paths, MCPB metadata, MongoDB defaults,
  npm bootstrapper naming, and release/staging docs/workflows.
- Work 1-2 recruiting domain models, Mongo collection contracts, storage
  wrappers, normalization, and internal create/lifecycle services are in place.
- Work 3-4 deterministic recruiting fit scoring, feedback adjustments,
  recommendation builders, recommendation services, and M0-safe retrieval are
  in place.
- Work 5-6 recruiting MCP tools, tool-surface registration, metrics, and report
  export are in place.
- Work 7 demo/sample/docs paths are in place, including fictional recruiting
  demo data, local sample recruiting persistence, and local recruiting
  migration to MongoDB.
- Recruiting-first natural-question smoke is available through
  `recruit-ai smoke-natural-questions --pack recruiting`.

Immediate quality order:

1. Finish current-doc cleanup.
   - Keep active docs aligned to Recruit AI package names, env prefixes,
     sample/full/pro profile behavior, MCPB package naming, and recruiting
     first-use workflows.
   - Treat historical docs as archive instead of rewriting every old milestone
     entry.
   - Preserve docs-first pause checkpoints when a long autonomous loop stops
     for maintainer review, including what changed, what was verified, what is
     still risky, and the next narrow implementation unit.
2. Broaden the recruiting-first natural-question smoke pack.
   - Current coverage includes recruiting metrics, candidate-to-position
     matching, position-to-candidate matching, feedback-informed scoring,
     active submissions, learned client preferences, candidate risk flags, and
     raw-content safety, plus client/candidate/position intake coverage and an
     in-memory recruiting report preview.
   - Latest full recruiting smoke checkpoint regenerated the 17-question pack
     after the `rq14`-`rq17` validator hardening and passed the current
     validator contract.
   - Local personal recruiting persistence is covered with a temp
     `recruiting.json` save/reload case that avoids touching the user's real
     `~/.recruit-ai` data.
   - Recommendation guardrails now check that keyword-strong but risky sample
     candidates do not outrank aligned matches when compensation, location,
     availability, seniority, or scope constraints matter.
   - Recommendation guardrail smoke now records compact risk-flag and
     next-question coverage counts, and the validator checks that guardrail
     evidence rows actually carry those fields plus all eight recruiting fit
     dimension scores.
   - Recommendation guardrail and shortlist smoke now require the inferred
     `skill_gap` flag to stay visible in generated payloads.
   - Candidate-to-position smoke now shows open-role defaults and the paused
     sample role excluded from first-pass recommendations, including a compact
     quick-read summary in CLI smoke output.
   - Client shortlist readiness now checks that each open sample position has
     a ranked candidate shortlist with visible review risk flags and next
     questions, including compact quick-read coverage counts and candidate
     dimension scores.
   - Saved recommendation-run review now checks that stored recommendation
     runs can be read back with fit snapshots, feedback-adjustment ledgers,
     risk rows, and next-question rows intact.
   - Saved recommendation-run smoke validation now checks actual saved result
     rows for feedback-adjustment, risk-flag, and next-question evidence,
     instead of trusting summary counts alone.
   - Candidate-side exclusion smoke validation now checks the actual excluded
     role result row for `client_exclusion` and the exclusion follow-up
     question, instead of trusting summary counts alone.
   - MCP wrapper tests now cover inferred `skill_gap` risk flags across
     recommendation save and read-back through the public tool surface.
   - MCP wrapper tests now also cover candidate-to-position client exclusion
     risk flags and follow-up questions across save/read-back.
   - Service-layer recommendation tests now cover inferred `skill_gap` risk
     flags across save and read-back serialization.
   - Service-layer recommendation tests now also cover inferred
     `domain_mismatch` and `seniority_mismatch` risk flags across save and
     read-back serialization.
   - Service-layer recommendation tests now also cover candidate-to-position
     client-exclusion ordering, risk flags, and follow-up questions across save
     and read-back serialization.
   - Workflow trace safety smoke now checks that opt-in local trace events are
     written with redaction for raw recruiting notes, MongoDB URIs,
     API-key-shaped values, and raw result content.
   - Workflow trace smoke validation now also checks trace written/enabled/
     exists evidence, max/recent event counts, and the expected recent tool
     name, instead of only checking redaction counts.
   - Recruiting report export smoke now writes CSV and Markdown artifacts to a
     temporary directory and checks that restricted fields stay out of the
     smoke payload and generated files.
   - Recruiting report export smoke validation now also checks generated row
     counts, CSV row count, Markdown line count, and the quick briefing, instead
     of only checking artifact existence.
   - `export_recruiting_report` unit coverage now also checks that candidate
     risk flags, preference notes, and evidence summaries do not leak into
     generated CSV or Markdown artifacts.
   - Keep the inherited deal-intelligence natural-question pack as a
     compatibility smoke, not the primary Recruit AI user journey.
3. Tighten release/package verification.
   - Keep `recruit-ai-mcp` PyPI/npm/MCPB naming aligned across
     `pyproject.toml`, `npm/package.json`, `mcpb/manifest.json`, GitHub
     Actions, README, and release docs.
   - Release docs now require the current recruiting smoke contract's
     `skill_gap` surfaced-risk checks for guardrail and shortlist payloads.
   - Record fresh public `npx recruit-ai-mcp@0.1.0` smoke evidence before
     claiming public registry readiness for this fork.
4. Improve recruiting recommendation quality with realistic fixtures.
   - Initial stress coverage now includes a strong healthcare platform
     candidate whose compensation, location, availability, and risk constraints
     should prevent a naive keyword match from outranking the aligned candidate.
   - Additional stress coverage now includes a junior OrbitPay keyword match
     whose payments stack fit should not outrank the senior aligned candidate.
   - Additional stress coverage now includes a Northstar healthcare platform
     keyword match whose manager-only scope, passive availability, and
     compensation constraints should not outrank the aligned staff IC match.
   - Additional stress coverage now includes an OrbitPay payments candidate
     whose strong stack match is outweighed by a learned negative client
     preference for candidates who need heavy role shaping before interviews.
     Recommendation rows now surface that condition with a
     `client_preference_conflict` risk flag.
   - Additional stress coverage now includes a Northstar healthcare workflow
     candidate whose adjacent domain fit should not outrank the aligned staff
     candidate while required Python and data-platform evidence is missing.
   - Additional stress coverage now includes a candidate-side client exclusion
     that lowers client-preference fit, raises match risk, and asks whether
     the exclusion can be revisited before shortlisting. Recommendation rows
     now surface that condition with a `client_exclusion` risk flag.
   - Recommendation rows now surface inferred `compensation_mismatch` risk
     flags when a candidate expectation is materially above the role ceiling
     even if the candidate profile did not already carry a compensation risk
     note.
   - Recommendation rows now surface inferred `retention_risk` flags and a
     counteroffer/retention mitigation question when captured candidate risk
     notes mention counteroffers, retention, or close-plan fragility.
   - Recommendation rows now surface inferred `evidence_gap` flags and a source
     evidence confirmation question when a keyword-strong candidate has no
     captured candidate evidence.
   - Recommendation rows now surface inferred `process_conflict` flags and a
     competing-process or offer-deadline plan question when a strong candidate
     has an active competing process.
   - Recommendation rows now surface inferred `low_confidence_evidence` flags
     and a direct-source confirmation question when a keyword-strong candidate
     is backed only by internal, unknown, or outbound-unconfirmed evidence.
   - Recommendation rows now surface inferred `location_policy_mismatch` flags
     when candidate remote/location preferences conflict with a location-bound
     role for reasons other than work authorization.
   - Recommendation rows now surface inferred `skill_gap` flags when a
     candidate covers only a small portion of role must-have skills and missing
     required-skill follow-up questions are present.
   - Recommendation tests now cover de-duplication when equivalent
     human-written skill, domain, or seniority risk notes are already present.
   - Generic match-risk handling now avoids adding `review_match_risk` when an
     existing `high_match_risk` already represents the elevated raw risk.
   - The recruiting domain-model contract now documents the normalized
     inferred recommendation risk flags emitted by the deterministic builder.
   - Docs-current tests now compare the documented inferred-risk list with the
     source `flags.append(...)` values in the recommendation builder.
   - Recommendation rows now surface inferred `domain_mismatch` flags when
     candidate skills are aligned but captured domain history does not clearly
     transfer to the role context.
   - Recommendation rows now surface inferred `seniority_mismatch` flags when
     candidate seniority is below the role's target seniority and no explicit
     seniority-related risk note is already present.
   - Continue adding synthetic client/candidate examples that stress skills,
     domain, seniority, compensation, location, availability, client
     preferences, evidence quality, and risk.
   - Keep scoring deterministic and inspectable before adding optional LLM
     narrative layers.
5. Add recruiting workflow observability only after the core path is stable.
   - Foundation is in place for opt-in local workflow trace files with bounded
     retention and secret-safe argument/result summaries.
   - MCP tool calls now write one opt-in trace event per host call when
     `RECRUIT_AI_WORKFLOW_TRACE=1` or config enables workflow tracing.
   - `recruit-ai local-data trace-status` and `trace-reset` can inspect and
     dry-run-first clear local workflow trace files.
   - Store secret-safe local metadata only: timestamp, tool name, duration,
     success/error category, redacted argument summary, and compact result
     summary.
   - Never store raw recruiting interaction content, contacts, embeddings,
     API keys, OAuth tokens, MongoDB URIs, or full tool responses.

Deferred:

- Full Python package rename from `deal_intel` to a recruit-specific import
  path. Keep it staged until tests, MCPB launchers, and downstream docs can move
  together.
- Pro-scale Atlas Vector Search hardening beyond M0-safe retrieval.
- CRM-like people graph and multi-workspace switching.
- Broad inherited deal-tool renaming beyond compatibility labeling.

## Historical Planning Archive

The sections below describe the inherited Deal Intelligence v1/v2 roadmap and
are retained for traceability. They are not the active Recruit AI backlog.

### Inherited Deal-Intel Post-v1 / v2 Roadmap

Goal: turn the v1 MVP into a customizable deal-intelligence framework while
keeping the product usable for one-person or small AI-assisted sales teams.

Current positioning:

- v1/v2 public package line is useful enough to try, honest about limitations,
  and optimized for AI-assisted setup with `full`/MongoDB as the default
  real-data path.
- v2 should deepen the product and architecture before adding a no-clone
  wrapper. The main risk after v1 is not installation friction; it is hardcoded
  product assumptions becoming expensive to undo.
- MEDDPICC remains the default qualification framework, not the permanent
  product identity. The system should eventually support user-defined
  qualification dimensions, weights, extraction hints, and stage rules.
- MongoDB Free/M0-compatible hardening belongs in `full`; paid-infra paths such
  as Atlas Vector Search at scale belong in `pro`.
- The public `npx` path now exists. Future distribution work should harden
  prerequisite detection, cross-platform smoke, and installer UX rather than
  adding another thin wrapper.

Current v2 state:

- Public release now includes PyPI `deal-intel-mcp==0.2.1`, npm
  `deal-intel-mcp@0.2.1`, MCPB artifacts, and the git-clone/customizer path.
- Architecture developer-map expansion is in place in [architecture.md](architecture.md).
- Qualification Framework v2 is implemented as the default architecture:
  MEDDPICC remains the immutable built-in default preset, while custom
  frameworks can be created, validated, activated, and backfilled.
- Product / solution context is implemented and merged into `main`:
  local seller-side RAG cache, configured source folders, managed pasted notes,
  `txt`/`md`/`json`/`csv`/`pdf`/`docx` support, large-catalog guardrails,
  product-context refs in `add_interaction`, and strategy use in
  `analyze_deal`.
- MongoDB MDB-0 through MDB-6 are implemented and merged into `main`:
  chart-ready contracts, refresh engine, chart-ready Atlas specs, Mongo doctor
  checks, Pro Atlas Vector Search static hardening, live M10+ vector smoke, and
  final integration packaging.
- `release/latest/` now points at MCPB `0.2.1`.
- `AI_START_HERE.md` documents the current install routes for
  non-developers, beginners, and developers.
- The v2 readiness gate with UX friction review found no blocker. Functional
  smoke passed across tests, config/profile flow, natural questions,
  deal-review audit, product context, Mongo/Atlas chart-ready data,
  export/report, and distribution surfaces.
- The v2 polish close-out gate found no release blocker. Report readability,
  runtime diagnostics, storage hints, product-context cold-start messaging, and
  chart-ready dry-run UX are now good enough for public trial. Deal-review
  quality is intentionally moved to usage-driven post-v2 improvement.

Immediate post-v2 quality order:

1. Report Quality v2.
   - Started on 2026-06-18 with human-facing Markdown header polish:
     visible report timestamps now use the configured reporting timezone while
     machine `generated_at` remains UTC.
   - Pipeline trend Markdown now has timezone-aware headers, deterministic
     executive-summary bullets, and readable KPI formatting for counts, money,
     health percentages, and deltas.
   - Treat `export_report` as meeting/manager-report generation, not a ledger
     dump.
   - Keep deterministic metrics as the source of truth, but allow host-assisted
     narrative generation or an explicit cost-visible server-side narrative
     mode.
   - Prefer polished Markdown/DOCX/PDF-style output for weekly review; reserve
     CSV for ledger-style `export_data`.
2. Deal Review Quality v2.
   - Revisit review scoring after framework abstraction.
   - Separate evidence-rich but risky deals from evidence-poor deals with high
     uncertainty.
   - Preserve the CTA vs observation distinction: objective missing items such
     as dates or committed next steps can produce actions; subjective gaps such
     as competition/context should often be observations unless stronger
     evidence supports action.
   - Add corner-case synthetic datasets from realistic meetings, emails, and
     user interviews to stress the review engine.
3. Tool namespace and customer-theme workflow cleanup.
   - Keep broad renaming deferred until real host-agent confusion appears.
   - Continue strengthening tool descriptions and catalog workflow hints.
   - Revisit `get_customer_themes`, `get_customer_theme_breakdown`, and
     `get_customer_theme_evidence` only if smoke traces show unnecessary
     multi-tool friction.
4. Usage and cost tracking v2.
   - Extend the v1 usage tool beyond LLM calls when useful: report generation,
     embedding/search work, MongoDB/Atlas assumptions, and maintenance
     backfills.
   - Keep cost numbers explicitly labeled as estimates unless pulled from a
     provider billing API.
5. Tool-call audit trail and workflow trace.
   - Add a secret-safe local audit trail for MCP tool calls so successful host
     workflows can be debugged and repeated.
   - Primary use case: capture high-quality answer paths such as
     `get_product_context` -> `search_deals` -> `get_deal` -> host synthesis.
   - Store only safe metadata: timestamp, tool name, duration, success/error
     category, redacted argument summary, and compact result summary.
   - Never store raw interaction content, raw notes, raw product documents,
     contacts, embeddings, API keys, OAuth tokens, MongoDB URIs, or full tool
     responses.
   - Treat this as an observability and support feature, not a replacement for
     `get_usage`. Consider opt-in/local-only retention, bounded log size, and
     developer-surface inspection first.

V2 readiness UX polish queue:

- Environment drift diagnostics: done on 2026-06-18. `config show` and
  `config doctor` now report package metadata version, source-tree version,
  Python executable, module location, and version mismatch warnings.
- Mongo/export storage errors: done on 2026-06-18. Export storage failures now
  include secret-safe next-action hints instead of returning `hint: null`.
  `mongo doctor` also uses the same classifier for DNS/network, auth, missing
  URI, and Atlas failover-style failures.
- Product-context cold start: done on 2026-06-18. Product-context retrieval and
  `analyze_deal` now distinguish disabled context, missing embeddings,
  loading/not-started embeddings, failed warmup, empty index, and ready states.
- Deal-review uncertainty wording: done on 2026-06-18. Deal reviews now include
  structured `uncertainty_reasons` and compact `uncertainty_reason_codes`,
  including the case where seller-side product context exists but cannot replace
  customer-stated evidence.
- V2 polish final gate: done on 2026-06-18. Ruff, full pytest, natural-question
  smoke, deal-review audit, profile smoke, dashboard crosscheck, and
  chart-ready dry-run passed. Current live `mongo doctor` can still surface
  local DNS timeout as `dns_or_network`; this is actionable and not a release
  blocker.
- Chart-ready dry-run polish: done on 2026-06-18. `mongo refresh-chart-ready`
  now accepts explicit `--dry-run`, rejects `--apply --dry-run`, and returns
  secret-safe storage hints for DNS/network/auth style failures.
- Keep the corrected MCPB packing rule: run pack from `mcpb/` with
  `mcpb pack . deal-intel-mcp-<version>.mcpb`; do not pack from the repo root
  with `mcpb` as the source directory.

Deferred after v2 closure:

1. Product-context follow-ups driven by usage.
   - PPTX/XLSX parser support or clearer "export to PDF first" UX.
   - Managed-note/file update/delete convenience.
   - `config_doctor` visibility for indexed document count, partial-indexing
     warnings, and cache health.
   - Optional Mongo/shared product context storage after local cache proves
     useful.
2. Bootstrapper polish and install UX hardening.
   - Keep the current npx path, but improve prerequisite detection and
     cross-platform guidance.
   - Add or refresh Windows/macOS fresh-machine smoke notes after meaningful
     packaging changes.
   - Keep MCPB as the host configuration surface and npx/PyPI as the runtime
     installation path.
3. Runtime and Mongo diagnostic repair UX.
   - Add a user-facing repair path for source/package version drift after the
     diagnostic identifies it.
   - Consider a more nuanced Mongo doctor result when chart-ready/report reads
     succeed but the initial ping path sees transient DNS timeout.
4. Post-v2 workspace/project profiles.
   - Support multiple sales workspaces without editing global config by hand.
   - A workspace should bundle at least MongoDB database name, optional URI
     reference, default currency, qualification framework, reporting output
     path, and product/solution context pointers.
   - Keep project switching explicit, e.g. `workspace list/add/switch`, so a
     user managing multiple products or client projects does not accidentally
     mix deal records, charts, reports, embeddings, or tuning preferences.
   - Treat this as post-v2 because the qualification framework and tool surface
     need to stabilize first.
5. Dockerized self-hosted remote kit.
   - Provide a deployment path for users who want mobile or remote access
     without turning this project into a managed SaaS operated by the
     maintainer.
   - Package the MCP server as a Docker/container deployment that can run on
     user-owned infrastructure such as Cloud Run, Fly.io, Railway, Render,
     ECS/Fargate, a VM, or an internal Kubernetes cluster.
   - Keep the product promise: user-owned MongoDB, user-owned LLM/API keys,
     user-owned product-context storage, and explicit operator control over
     costs and data retention.
   - Minimum deliverables:
     - Dockerfile or equivalent container image build;
     - environment-variable based config for MongoDB, LLM provider, reporting,
       tool surface, and product-context paths;
     - health/readiness endpoint or command;
     - example deploy guides for one low-friction platform;
     - security notes for TLS, auth, rate limiting, secret storage, and network
       access;
     - clear warning that exposed remote MCP endpoints need authentication and
       must not be published unauthenticated.
   - Do not build a maintainer-operated cloud service until real usage justifies
     tenant isolation, billing, JWT/OAuth lifecycle, support, incident response,
     and data protection responsibilities.
6. MongoDB Atlas Terraform PoC template: done on 2026-06-21.
   - Added a small, repeatable Infrastructure-as-Code template for the `full`
     and `pro` Atlas setup path.
   - Suggested location:
     `infra/mongodb-atlas/versions.tf`, `provider.tf`, `variables.tf`,
     `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and `README.md`.
   - Initial scope:
     - Atlas project;
     - M0/Flex/dev cluster by default;
     - database user;
     - IP access list;
     - connection string output;
     - optional variables for backup/search/vector-search and dev/stage/prod
       separation.
   - Keep Terraform responsible for infrastructure only. Deal records, sample
     data, app-level migrations, chart-ready refreshes, schema application, and
     product-context indexing remain CLI/app responsibilities.
   - Safety requirements:
     - do not commit `.tfvars`, local state, Atlas API keys, DB passwords, or
       generated connection strings;
     - document that Terraform state may contain sensitive values and should be
       kept out of git, ideally in encrypted remote state for real use;
     - start with a new dev project/cluster before importing existing Atlas
       resources;
     - avoid broad `0.0.0.0/0` access outside short-lived PoC usage;
     - consider `prevent_destroy` or explicit warnings before managing any
       environment containing real deal data;
     - keep paid/pro capabilities behind explicit variables so PoC defaults
       stay cost-safe.

V2 closure validation gate:

- Full automated gate:
  - `pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider --basetemp=<repo-local-temp>`
  - `ruff check .`
  - `mcpb validate mcpb\manifest.json`
  - from `mcpb/`, `mcpb pack . deal-intel-mcp-<version>.mcpb`
  - `mcpb info mcpb\deal-intel-mcp-<version>.mcpb`
- Smoke suites:
  - natural-question smoke
  - deal-review audit
  - report/export smoke
  - tool catalog/profile surface smoke
  - config doctor in the intended `full` profile
  - product-context host-app smoke with a real configured source folder and
    at least one PDF source
- Manual notes:
  - record any Windows temp/sandbox limitations separately from product
    failures;
  - confirm large product-context files either fully index or return clear
    `partial_indexed` warnings;
  - confirm no raw product docs, raw interaction content, secrets, contacts, or
    embeddings leak through read/report paths.

MongoDB feature placement rule:

- `full` should include MongoDB-backed features that run on Atlas Free/M0 and
  help ordinary teams operate real data, such as schema validation, ordinary
  indexes, bounded change-stream consumers that respect Free-cluster filter
  limits, and time-series collections for analytics snapshots/events if they
  materially simplify the product.
- `pro` should be reserved for paid infrastructure, paid API defaults, scale
  paths, or admin automation that assumes capabilities beyond Free/M0, such as
  dedicated search/analytics nodes, Atlas Vector Search at scale, paid-tier
  cluster operations, and API-key LLM operation by default.
- Before promoting a MongoDB ecosystem feature to `full`, add a mock/contract
  test and, when practical, a Free-cluster smoke note. If the feature creates
  paid-infra or cost risk, keep it in `pro`.

### LLM Cost And Host-App Delegation

Goal: reduce provider cost and latency while preserving extraction quality for
persistent deal intelligence.

Design stance:

- The host app LLM, such as Claude Desktop, Codex, or ChatGPT, should handle
  explanation, synthesis, user-facing wording, setup guidance, and
  confirmation questions from deterministic MCP payloads.
- The server-side LLM provider should be reserved for work that creates or
  updates persistent structured deal intelligence: interaction extraction,
  customer-theme extraction/backfills, and explicit strategy generation.
- Read-only BI calculations, data exports, reviews, gap lists, metrics, and
  dashboard support should remain deterministic and server-side LLM-free.
- Human-facing report prose may be host-assisted when the MCP response carries
  a deterministic data pack and all numbers remain traceable to that pack.
- Any new tool that calls the server-side LLM must state that cost/latency in
  its tool contract and docs.

Current product decision:

- Keep `add_interaction` quality-first for now. It currently makes two LLM
  calls per run: structured extraction and a short summary. Merging those calls
  is a valid later optimization, but not worth the output-quality and JSON
  parsing risk at current usage levels.
- GPT-5.4 mini pricing as of 2026-06-14 is low enough that a typical
  one-person/small-team BD workflow does not justify weakening extraction
  quality for cost alone. A rough high-activity day with 20 emails and 5
  meetings is estimated around a few hundred KRW; ordinary usage should usually
  be below that. Monthly cost is expected to be in the low-thousands KRW range
  for this scale.
- The expected savings from merging the two `add_interaction` calls would not
  cleanly halve the total run cost because output tokens, prompt complexity,
  parsing retries, and quality regression risk still remain.

Near-term candidates:

1. Reclassify `analyze_deal` as an optional strategy-generation tool.
   - Prefer `get_deal_review` for default deal review because it is
     deterministic and LLM-free.
   - Use `analyze_deal` only when the user explicitly asks for generated BD
     strategy text or wants to persist `bd_strategy`.
2. Usage/cost visibility tool - implemented in v1 polish.
   - `get_usage` and `deal-intel usage` report persisted server-side LLM calls
     by tool, provider, model, operation, and date window.
   - Cost is labeled as an estimate. ChatGPT OAuth is tracked as zero
     incremental API cost; API-provider pricing is calculated only when
     `usage.pricing` is configured.
   - Current scope is LLM usage. MongoDB/Atlas and embedding runtime cost remain
     future work.
   - Usage payloads avoid raw content, prompts, API keys, OAuth tokens, and
     MongoDB URIs.
3. Keep customer-theme backfill as an explicit maintenance/admin flow.
   - It is for legacy meeting data, migration, and theme logic refreshes rather
     than day-to-day user interaction.
   - Document that it may incur LLM cost when run over many historical
     meetings.
4. Keep batch/deferred interaction processing as a long-term optimization
   candidate.
   - Useful if usage grows enough that many interactions are captured daily.
   - Not urgent for v1 because it adds operational complexity and asks users to
     think about save-vs-enrich timing.
5. Consider host-assisted extraction later.
   - A host app could pass a structured extraction payload into a validation
     tool, but this needs careful schema validation and source handling because
     host prompts are less reproducible than server-side extraction.

Acceptance principles:

- No LLM calls in metric/data-export calculation paths. Human report wording can
  use the host app or an explicit, cost-visible server-side report mode as long
  as deterministic metrics remain the source of truth.
- No silent downgrade in data quality: any future raw-only/deferred intake must
  clearly show that health/themes are not updated yet.
- No secret exposure in cost/usage reports.
- Natural-language smoke tests should still answer common read-only questions
  without server-side LLM calls.

### Public Launch Hygiene

Goal: make every public release/fresh-clone handoff safe, reproducible, and not
tied to the maintainer's local machine.

Trigger:

- Before publishing a public repo update, package artifact, MCPB bundle, install
  guide, README onboarding flow, or external evaluator handoff.
- Whenever a reviewer reports personal paths, stale environment names, tool
  count drift, secret risk, or fresh-clone setup ambiguity.

Reusable workflow:

- Use the Codex `launch-hygiene` skill for the full audit. It is intentionally
  repo-agnostic so the same checklist can be reused for future tools.

Required v1 launch hygiene checks:

1. Personal/local leakage scan.
   - Scan public docs, package manifests, source comments, config examples,
     scripts, and tests for local usernames, machine paths, old sibling project
     names, old environment names, absolute generated-output paths, and copied
     private context.
   - Legitimate public GitHub owner/package metadata can remain.
   - Replace local examples with placeholders or "run `sys.executable` and use
     the printed path."
2. Secret and local config handling.
   - Verify `.env`, local override YAML, generated outputs, packaged archives,
     caches, and smoke artifacts are ignored unless intentionally tracked.
   - Keep safe templates such as `.env.example`.
   - Never store API keys, OAuth tokens, MongoDB URIs, or user-local absolute
     paths in tracked files.
3. Fresh-clone reproducibility.
   - Confirm install docs start from a clean clone mental model, not from the
     maintainer's existing conda environment.
   - Confirm full mode remains the recommended real-data path, while sample
     mode is clearly framed as zero-config trial/local personal mode.
4. Documentation/code alignment.
   - Compare documented commands, profile names, tool surfaces, config keys,
     package names, and manifest fields with actual CLI help, tests, and source.
   - Avoid hardcoding tool counts in user-facing docs when a doctor/smoke
     command can report them more reliably.
5. Generated artifact hygiene.
   - Confirm generated reports, smoke outputs, Atlas renders, bundle outputs,
     caches, and local DB files are either ignored or intentionally included.
   - Do not delete local/generated artifacts without user approval.

Near-term action:

- Run this hygiene gate once before v1.0 tagging and again after any packaging
  or install-guide change.
- Keep the result in `docs/status.md` with exact scans and validation commands.

### MCP Tool Design Cleanup

Goal: make the tool surface easier for AI hosts to choose from without slowing
down v1.0.

Reference principles:

- Design tools around agent workflows, not internal API endpoints.
- Keep tool purposes distinct and explicit.
- Return high-signal context and avoid unnecessary token load.
- Improve tools through realistic evaluation prompts and smoke traces, not just
  by guessing from schema shape.

Current assessment:

- The current profile-filtered surfaces already solve the biggest context-load
  issue: `sample`, `standard`, and `developer` hide demo/maintenance tools from
  ordinary users.
- `update_deal` has many parameters, but it is still one coherent intent:
  confirmed value and selected metadata correction. Do not split it just because
  the schema is wide. Revisit only if unrelated decision types start entering
  the tool.
- Customer theme analysis is the strongest post-v1 consolidation candidate
  because ranking, breakdown, and evidence are one user intent split across
  several tools.

v1 polish:

1. Improve MCP tool descriptions and user docs with explicit selection
   guidance:
   - "Use this when..."
   - "Do not use this for..."
   - "For this adjacent task, use `<other_tool>` instead."
2. Clarify README/AI_START_HERE tool-surface guidance so AI hosts understand
   that ordinary users should mostly see the `standard` surface, while
   `developer` is for maintainers and fixture/debug work.
3. Keep natural-question smoke traces as the main evaluation signal for whether
   tool descriptions are steering the host correctly.

Post-v1:

1. Consolidate customer theme tools after observing real host usage:
   - Keep `get_customer_themes` as the ranking-oriented entry point.
   - Current QF-9 direction keeps existing names and adds workflow hints instead
     of a hard rename.
   - Add optional depth controls such as `include_breakdown` /
     `include_evidence` or a small `detail_level` enum only if host tool choice
     remains noisy after description, response workflow metadata, and catalog
     improvements.
   - Preserve current lower-level tools temporarily as compatibility aliases if
     a future unified theme tool is added.
2. Audit `update_deal` field groups:
   - Keep it if all fields remain "confirmed deal metadata correction."
   - Split only if future fields introduce distinct workflows such as
     ownership/contact graph management, approval policies, forecast overrides,
     or framework configuration.

Post-v2 or later:

1. Add response verbosity controls such as `response_format=concise|detailed`
   only after tool outputs show meaningful token pressure in real traces.
2. Consider broader tool namespace changes only as a breaking-version cleanup.
   Renaming public tools before real usage feedback would create more migration
   burden than value.

### User Memory MCP Tools

Goal: let non-developer users teach the assistant their sales motion, reporting
preferences, taxonomy corrections, metric-tuning feedback, and evidence policy
without manually editing files.

Design stance:

- `user_docs/` is the repo-local user memory area.
- User-created documents are allowed, including documents the user explicitly
  asks an AI assistant to create.
- The MCP surface should be a narrow user-memory API, not a
  general-purpose file editor.
- Built-in categories are useful defaults, but custom Markdown documents should
  be allowed through safe slugs so teams can create notes such as
  `pricing-objections.md` or `public-sector-sales-notes.md`.

Implemented tools:

- `record_user_memory`
  - Append durable feedback to a built-in category file or a user-requested
    custom Markdown document.
  - Use only when the user explicitly says to remember, record, store, or update
    a durable preference.
- `get_user_memory`
  - Read relevant memory documents so the AI assistant can adapt responses,
    reports, taxonomy suggestions, and metric-tuning proposals.

Safety rules:

- Restrict writes to `user_docs/` or a configured user-memory directory.
- Allow only safe Markdown file slugs directly under that directory.
- Reject path traversal, absolute paths, hidden files, executable extensions,
  and nested paths unless a later policy explicitly allows them.
- Append by default; full-document rewrites require an explicit cleanup or
  consolidation request.
- Never store API keys, OAuth tokens, MongoDB URIs, private keys, session
  cookies, or other credential-like strings. Mask low-risk accidental snippets
  when possible and reject high-risk secret-shaped values.

Implemented:

- Shared `user_memory` module with path resolution, slug validation,
  category/custom-document routing, and secret scanning.
- MCP `get_user_memory` read tool.
- MCP `record_user_memory` append tool.
- Docs, MCPB manifest, and MCP tool-surface updates.

Deferred:

- Optional CLI helpers only if packaging or smoke tests need them.
- Future cleanup/consolidation tools for rewriting user-memory documents after
  explicit user request.

### Currency Abstraction - Implemented 2026-06-12

Goal: remove currency-specific field names from the core schema so the product
can serve non-KRW teams without making every metric/report feel tied to one
market.

Preferred v1 canonical fields:

- `deal_size_amount`
- `deal_size_low_amount`
- `deal_size_high_amount`
- `deal_size_currency`

Configuration:

```yaml
deal_value:
  default_currency: KRW
```

Implementation stance:

- Do not preserve `_krw` fields as a long-term public contract. There are no
  external users yet, so schema clarity is worth the one-time migration.
- Existing fixture/sample data, tests, reports, metrics, Atlas chart specs, and
  docs should move to the generic names together.
- If compatibility aliases are needed during implementation, keep them local to
  migration/read helpers and remove or mark them temporary before v1.0.
- Output labels should include currency explicitly, for example
  `pipeline_value_amount` plus `currency`, or user-facing labels such as
  `Pipeline value (configured currency)`.

Acceptance criteria:

- `create_deal` and `update_deal` accept the new amount/currency fields.
- Pipeline metrics no longer expose single-currency canonical keys.
- Reports and Atlas specs render values with the configured/default currency.
- Local sample fixtures and Mongo migration paths use the new schema.
- Full pytest, Ruff, natural smoke, report smoke, and Atlas chart render tests
  pass.

Follow-up:

- Atlas Charts remain easiest to operate as one reporting currency per
  dashboard. Python metrics and reports already detect mixed currencies and
  expose per-currency breakdowns.

### Industry And Customer Segment Taxonomy Cleanup

Status: field support, read-only audit, and confirmed cleanup CLI are
implemented; existing live data cleanup is still an operator action because
medium-confidence rows require judgment.

Goal: keep `industry` useful for real vertical analysis while still preserving
account-stage and account-segment labels that matter for BD strategy.

Rules:

- `industry` should be a true business vertical, such as Finance, Retail,
  Healthcare, Logistics, Manufacturing, Education, Government, Insurance,
  Gaming, or Energy.
- `customer_segment` should hold maturity, ownership, market segment, or
  funding-stage labels such as startup, enterprise, mid_market,
  public_sector, Series B, or Pre-IPO.
- Expected-close defaults should prefer `days_by_segment`, then
  `days_by_industry`, then `default_days`.

Deferred work:

- Review medium-confidence rows manually. These rows include sensemaking
  explanations because choosing between two plausible industries can change
  charts, reporting groups, and future search behavior.
- Add optional `customer_segment` filters/grouping to Customer Themes and Atlas
  Charts after the existing dashboard is stable.

### Qualification Framework Abstraction v2.0

Goal: eventually allow teams to replace or extend the default MEDDPICC
qualification model without forking the whole product.

Detailed plan:

- See [qualification-framework-v2.md](qualification-framework-v2.md) for the
  active QF-0 through QF-9 execution plan, templates/wizard direction,
  verification gates, and corner-case checklist.

Timing:

- Deferred until after v1.0.
- Treat as v2.0 work on a dedicated branch or separate repository if the
  blast radius grows.

Why deferred:

- The current code intentionally uses MEDDPICC as the default operating model.
- The dimension list is embedded in extraction prompts, health calculation,
  stage-aware gap logic, deal review, reports, Atlas chart specs, tests, and
  docs.
- Generalizing this before the MVP has real user feedback risks turning the
  product into a framework before the core workflow is proven.

Minimum future concept:

- A qualification framework has:
  - `framework_id`
  - dimensions with `key`, `label`, `weight`, score scale, and extraction
    description
  - optional stage-aware gap rules
  - optional framework-specific report labels
- Custom dimensions without stage rules should still work with simple
  threshold-based gap detection.
- Extraction descriptions are mandatory for custom dimensions. A dimension
  without instructions becomes a dead metric because the LLM will not know what
  evidence to collect.

### F-Mongo - Full-Profile MongoDB Hardening

Goal: make the normal MongoDB-backed `full` path operationally diagnosable and
safe on Atlas Free/M0 before spending effort on paid-infrastructure Pro paths.

Implemented slices:

- Versioned ordinary MongoDB index contract in code.
- `MongoDBClient.ensure_indexes()` now applies the shared contract.
- Read-only index/schema readiness checks.
- Permissive v1 `deals` collection validator resource.
- Permissive v1 `analytics_snapshots` and `delete_audit_logs` validator
  resources.
- CLI admin commands:

```bash
deal-intel mongo doctor
deal-intel mongo doctor --offline --json
deal-intel mongo apply-indexes --json
deal-intel mongo apply-indexes --apply
deal-intel mongo apply-schema --json
deal-intel mongo apply-schema --collection analytics_snapshots --json
deal-intel mongo apply-schema --collection delete_audit_logs --json
deal-intel mongo apply-schema --collection all --json
deal-intel mongo apply-schema --apply
```

Rules:

- `mongo doctor` is read-only.
- `apply-indexes` and `apply-schema` are dry-run unless `--apply` is provided.
- `apply-vector-index` is also dry-run unless `--apply` is provided and should
  be used only for the Pro/M10+ Atlas Vector Search path.
- Schema validation starts as `warn + moderate`; do not switch to hard
  `error` enforcement until the document model is stable and existing Atlas
  data has been audited.
- Keep this CLI/admin first. Add an MCP developer-surface tool only if users
  actually need to diagnose MongoDB from inside Claude/Codex chat.

Next candidate units:

1. Optional live Atlas smoke:
   - `deal-intel mongo doctor --json`
   - `deal-intel mongo apply-indexes --json`
   - `deal-intel mongo apply-schema --collection all --json`
   - `deal-intel mongo apply-schema --collection all --apply` only after
     manual confirmation.
   - `deal-intel mongo apply-vector-index --apply` only on an M10+ Pro cluster.
2. Evaluate whether `analytics_snapshots` should remain a normal collection or
   get a separate time-series/event collection after v1.0.
3. Evaluate bounded change-stream consumers only when there is a clear product
   workflow that benefits from them.

### Z5 - Profile and Config Rollout

Goal: keep one package while making first-run setup clear for `sample`, `full`,
and `pro`.

Next candidate units:

1. Optional live Atlas smoke for local personal -> MongoDB migration when a
   disposable target database is available.
2. Reinstall smoke with `deal-intel-mcp-0.1.15.mcpb` after the safe config
   update manifest change.
3. Decide whether release bundles need signing before external distribution.

Principle: human-facing setup starts with `full`. `sample` remains an optional
zero-config evaluation path for AI agents, demos, and users who explicitly do
not want to configure MongoDB yet.

### Deal Review Quality

Goal: make deal review feel useful to real sales operators, not like a toy
scorecard.

Backlog items:

- Implemented in v2: deal reviews now separate health quality, evidence
  coverage, confirmed risks, missing information, uncertainty, objective
  actionable gaps, and judgment-sensitive gap observations. Keep report and
  natural-language rendering aligned with this contract.
- Revisit MEDDPICC unknown-first scoring. Missing evidence should increase
  uncertainty instead of masquerading as neutral strength.
- Keep uncalibrated win-probability numbers suppressed unless a real
  probability contract exists.
- Use smoke packs to compare natural-language deal reviews across multiple
  companies.
- Add a dedicated corner-case synthetic dataset for deal review quality:
  - about 10 fictional accounts,
  - each with 1-3 synthetic evidence items such as meeting notes, customer email
    replies, user interviews, or internal notes,
  - intentionally cover suspicious edge cases: high health but weak evidence,
    low health with complete evidence, terminal won/lost postmortem gaps,
    strategic-zero deals, unknown amount in early discovery, rough estimate in
    negotiation, conflicting email vs meeting signals, internal-only optimism,
    overdue but otherwise healthy deals, and judgment-sensitive competition or
    champion gaps.
  - Use this as a QA fixture for `get_deal_review`,
    `smoke-deal-review-audit`, natural-language answer quality, and future
    rendered report review. Keep it fictional and free of raw real customer
    data.
- Natural Smoke QA expanded to 12 deterministic questions covering pipeline
  health, specific deal review, riskiest deals, high-health uncertainty,
  closing gaps, postmortem gaps, decision criteria themes, evidence drill-down,
  email/interview-backed themes, pipeline trend, actionability separation, and
  interaction source coverage.
- Implemented in v2, with follow-up rendering work still useful: separate
  objective CTA triggers from judgment-sensitive gap observations.
  - Objective triggers can produce explicit CTAs: overdue close dates,
    missed commitments, missing actual close dates for won/lost deals, missing
    close reasons for lost deals, or clearly required initiation steps.
  - Judgment-sensitive MEDDPICC gaps should usually be shown as gap points
    rather than prescriptive actions: competition, champion quality, economic
    buyer mapping, or decision criteria can depend on account context and BD
    strategy.
  - Reporting language should avoid making uncertain qualitative gaps sound
    like mandatory next actions. Example: "competition gap exists" is safer
    than "prepare competitor comparison and close negotiation" unless the
    account evidence objectively supports that action.
  - Current implementation: `get_deal_gaps` and `get_deal_review` gap rows
    include `actionability` and `cta_policy`; both expose `actionable_gaps` and
    `gap_observations`.
  - Weekly pipeline rows and Markdown reports render objective action items
    separately from gap observations.
  - Remaining follow-up: future document/Word renderers and LLM answer
    templates should keep the same distinction instead of flattening all gaps
    into recommended actions.

### Customer Interaction Intake

Goal: expand from "meeting-note intake" to a lightweight customer interaction
intelligence layer that can ingest emails, interviews, call summaries, and
internal notes without pretending every input is the same kind of evidence.

Priority: high, after the current Deal Review Quality loop and before deeper
Reporting/Pro infrastructure work. This improves local mode usefulness and
real-world data capture more than another dashboard/report would right now.

Candidate implementation units:

1. `add_interaction` read/write contract.
   - Inputs: `deal_id`, `date`, `interaction_type`, `direction`, `content`,
     optional `participants`, `subject`, `source_confidence`.
   - Interaction types: `meeting`, `email_thread`, `user_interview`,
     `call_summary`, `internal_note`.
   - Direction: `inbound`, `outbound`, `mixed`, `internal`.
   - Store source metadata so later scoring can distinguish customer-stated
     evidence from AE/internal notes or outbound claims.
2. Storage compatibility.
   - Keep `add_meeting` as a short-lived backward-compatible wrapper.
   - P3.2 decision: new records live under canonical `interactions`; old
     `meetings` remain supported as a legacy read fallback.
   - BI/report/search paths must continue to exclude raw content unless the
     user asks for single-deal detail.
3. Extraction prompt update.
   - Replace "meeting notes" assumptions with "customer interaction content".
   - Treat inbound customer email and direct user interview quotes as stronger
     evidence than outbound email or internal notes.
   - Outbound/internal-only content should create suggested follow-up questions
     or uncertainty, not confirmed MEDDPICC strength.
4. Evidence and uncertainty model.
   - Feed interaction source metadata into the unknown-first scoring work.
   - Distinguish confirmed risk, missing information, unconfirmed internal
     hypothesis, and customer-stated evidence.
5. Sample/local UX.
   - Add at least one sample email thread and one user interview fixture.
   - Add smoke questions such as "What did customers say in emails?" and
     "Which interview quotes support this pain?".

Open decision points:

- Whether to expose a new MCP tool only (`add_interaction`) or also add CLI
  import helpers for pasted email/interview files.
- Whether to add redaction/encryption policy for retained `raw_content` in
  local/full/pro storage.
- Whether outbound emails should update MEDDPICC scores immediately or only
  create weak/unconfirmed evidence.

Current implementation note:

- P3.0 exposed `add_meeting` in sample/local mode for user-created local
  personal deals.
- P3.1 added `add_interaction` as a meeting-compatible intake path for
  `meeting`, `email_thread`, `user_interview`, `call_summary`, and
  `internal_note`.
- P3.2 switched new writes to canonical `deal.interactions` only. `meetings`
  is now legacy read fallback, and helpers merge/dedupe both sources for
  existing data.
- P3.2 stores `interactions.raw_content` in local/full/pro storage for future
  redaction/security modules, but excludes it from BI/list/report/delete-audit
  paths.
- Custom interaction types must be registered under
  `interactions.custom_types`; arbitrary types are rejected.
- `outbound_unconfirmed` and `internal` inputs are stored with source metadata
  but do not update MEDDPICC health or customer-theme counts unless the caller
  explicitly marks the source as stronger evidence.
- P3.4 added source-aware sample evidence:
  - bundled fixture deals now include canonical `interactions` records while
    preserving legacy `meetings` for compatibility,
  - one inbound `email_thread` and one `user_interview` are included as
    curated evidence examples,
  - customer-theme evidence rows expose safe source metadata so agents can
    distinguish meeting, email, and interview support without reading raw
    content.
- P3.5 added source-aware filters to `get_customer_theme_evidence`:
  `interaction_type` and `source_confidence`. This lets agents answer
  questions like "show only email-backed evidence" without reading raw
  interaction content.
- P3.6 added source-aware rendering:
  - customer-theme evidence rows include a human-readable `source_label`,
  - weekly pipeline rows and Markdown reports show primary pain / decision
    criteria source labels,
  - the natural-question smoke summary includes a Source Evidence section so
    source-aware answers can be checked without reopening an MCP client.
- P3.7 closed the MVP intake contract:
  - `add_interaction` responses include `source_policy` so clients can explain
    confirmed-evidence versus stored-unconfirmed behavior,
  - first-run guidance now describes meeting, email, interview, call-summary,
    and internal-note intake through the single public tool,
  - policy text remains response-only and does not expand restricted BI/list/
    report projections.

#### P3.3 cleanup: single public intake surface

Goal: make the codebase easier for outside users and fork authors to
understand by removing "meeting tool vs interaction tool" ambiguity.
`add_interaction` should become the single public intake concept; meeting notes
are just `interaction_type: meeting`.

First cleanup implemented on 2026-06-11:

- `sample` and `standard` surfaces expose `add_interaction`, not
  `add_meeting`.
- `add_meeting` remains registered only on the `developer` surface as a
  deprecated compatibility alias.
- README, MCPB manifest text, baseline/tool-surface docs, AGENTS/CLAUDE rules,
  and primary tests now point new integrations to `add_interaction`.
- At implementation time, runtime surface counts were verified by targeted
  tests. See `docs/tool-surfaces.md` for current counts.

Why now:

- P3.2 already made `deal.interactions` the canonical storage path.
- Keeping `add_meeting` as a second first-class tool creates duplicate mental
  models for users and future contributors.
- The repo is intended to be reused by others, so public API clarity matters
  more than preserving a convenience alias forever.

Remaining implementation units:

1. Code cleanup.
   - Stop adding new feature logic to `src/deal_intel/tools/add_meeting.py`.
   - Keep the wrapper tiny or remove it once no test/docs path needs it.
   - Keep legacy `deal.meetings` read fallback in `schema.interactions`; that
     is data compatibility, not a public write API.
2. Final alias removal.
   - Remove `src/deal_intel/tools/add_meeting.py` and the MCP handler after at
     least one compatibility window, or when no supported client path needs it.
   - Keep one release note explaining the replacement call:
     `add_interaction(interaction_type="meeting", direction="inbound", ...)`.
3. Legacy data compatibility.
   - Keep `deal.meetings` read fallback covered by tests even after the write
     alias is removed.

Acceptance criteria:

- No user tutorial or README happy path requires `add_meeting`.
- `interaction_type: meeting` through `add_interaction` covers the former
  `add_meeting` behavior.
- If `add_meeting` remains, it is visibly deprecated and excluded from default
  user-facing surfaces, or there is a documented reason to keep it for one more
  release.
- Legacy `deal.meetings` read fallback remains covered by tests.
- Full pytest, Ruff, MCP/tool-surface count smoke, and MCPB manifest tests pass.

### Account People Graph

Goal: eventually track customer-side people and relationships as queryable
deal intelligence, especially Champion, Economic Buyer, decision committee,
procurement, security, legal, and blockers.

Priority: medium-long term. Do not implement before the deal review quality and
interaction intake work, but keep the design in mind because it will become a
natural query key for BD workflows.

Possible shape:

- Store people in a separate local NoSQL/Mongo collection or RDBMS-like table
  keyed by normalized company/account identity.
- Link people to deals by `company`/`account_id` and optionally `deal_id`.
- Track role labels such as `champion`, `economic_buyer`, `decision_maker`,
  `influencer`, `blocker`, `procurement`, `security`, and `legal`.
- Track confidence and evidence source:
  direct customer statement, meeting note, email thread, internal AE note, or
  inferred/unconfirmed.
- Let BD ask questions like:
  "Who is the champion at this account?",
  "Do we know the economic buyer?",
  "Who blocks security approval?",
  "Which accounts lack a mapped decision committee?".

Implementation cautions:

- Avoid turning this into a full CRM too early.
- Keep raw contact details out of default BI/report paths.
- Prefer explicit source/confidence metadata over silently treating every
  extracted person as confirmed.
- Decide later whether this belongs in MongoDB collections, local JSON/SQLite,
  or a small relational layer. The key requirement is account/company-indexed
  lookup and safe links back to deals.

### Customer Themes

Goal: make customer theme analysis more operationally useful.

Backlog items:

- Split `industry` from company maturity/stage taxonomy. Current data can mix
  true industry with descriptors such as startup, series stage, or enterprise.
- Defer customer-theme CSV until the human-readable reporting artifact has a
  clearer user and use case.
- Keep raw notes, contacts, and embeddings out of customer-theme dashboards and
  evidence responses.

### Reporting

Goal: make CSV/Markdown reports meaningfully different from Atlas dashboards.

Deferred questions:

- Should `weekly_pipeline` flatten primary pain, decision criteria, attention
  reasons, and data quality into reader-friendly columns?
- Should a separate `pipeline_performance` report exist for won/lost outcomes,
  booked value, lost value, win rate, close dates, and close reasons?
- Who is the intended reader: AE weekly review, executive status report,
  customer success handoff, or investor-style performance summary?
- How should CSV differ from Atlas Charts rather than being another raw
  dashboard export?

### Packaging

Goal: make the project easy for non-developers and fast evaluators.

Current MVP stance:

- `docs/mvp-readiness.md` is the full-by-default external MVP gate, with
  optional zero-config sample checks for AI evaluation.
- npx/uvx wrappers are useful, but not required before the first MVP trial.
- Packaging work should not preempt sample/local UX completion unless it
  directly reduces first-run confusion.
- `docs/distribution-plan.md` records the wrapper rollout order:
  package-data readiness first, then uvx/Python-native distribution, with npx
  as a thin convenience wrapper after the core package can run without a git
  checkout.

Backlog items:

- Keep one repository and one package.
- Expose `sample`, `full`, and `pro` through config profiles, not separate
  repositories.
- Keep the config-driven `sample`, `standard`, and `developer` MCP tool
  surfaces aligned with the actual tool set before a stable external release.
- Keep local personal mode safe for temporary user data. The `sample` profile
  starts with bundled fictional data, then switches active reads to local
  `deals.json` once a user creates personal deals. Reset/export is now
  available; real team/shared operation still uses MongoDB-backed `full`.
- Consider whether natural-language smoke tools should remain CLI-only in
  production bundles.
- Keep the dry-run-first local-to-Mongo migration path conservative; before
  release, live-smoke it against a disposable database.
- Keep `tests/test_mcpb_manifest.py` as the repo-local contract check for
  manifest fields, tool list alignment, environment mapping, and launcher
  behavior.
- Rebuild and attach a fresh `.mcpb` artifact after bundle manifest changes.
  Current local artifact target: `deal-intel-mcp-0.1.15.mcpb`; unsigned.

### Cost And Query Optimization

Goal: keep MongoDB reads cheap, predictable, and aligned across MCP, reports,
and Atlas Charts.

Next candidate units:

1. Deferred BI metrics allowlist projection.
   - Convert `list_deals_for_metrics()` from blacklist-style projection to
     allowlist-style projection after BI/review/report field contracts
     stabilize.
2. Optional Atlas `explain`/index smoke on a disposable or production-safe
   database.
   - O3 added the intended index contracts in code and tests, but did not run
     live Atlas index creation/explain as part of the local validation loop.

Audit record:

- See [query-audit.md](query-audit.md).

Completed:

- O3 index contract:
  - Added `(archived, deal_stage, updated_at desc)` for list views.
  - Added `(as_of, occurred_at, created_at)` for trend reads.

### Pro Infrastructure

Goal: define the paid-infrastructure upgrade path without making it mandatory.

Backlog items:

- Live smoke `openai_api` once disposable API credit is available.
- Add Atlas Vector Search validation for M10+ clusters.
- Explore MongoDB Change Streams, Time Series Collections, and Schema
  Validation after the core MVP is stable.

## Historical Milestone Summary

### M1 - Metric Foundation

Completed:

- Metric contracts for pipeline populations, health bands, value coverage,
  stuck/overdue, win rate, data quality, and reporting context.
- Shared `build_pipeline_health_summary`.
- `get_metrics(metric_type="pipeline_health")`.

See `docs/metrics.md` and `docs/baseline.md`.

### M2 - Weekly Reporting

Completed:

- Weekly pipeline row builder.
- UTF-8 BOM CSV export with formula-injection protection.
- LLM-free Markdown summary.
- `export_report(report_type="weekly_pipeline")`.

See `docs/reports.md`.

### M3 - Atlas Charts

Completed:

- Weekly Pipeline Review dashboard specs.
- Atlas UI setup runbook.
- Cross-check between `get_metrics`, CSV/Markdown, and Atlas aggregations.

See `docs/atlas-charts.md`.

### M4 - Data Quality and Lifecycle

Completed:

- `get_deal_gaps`.
- `update_deal` for confirmed value and selected metadata fields.
- `archive_deal`, `restore_deal`, and `delete_deal` safety layer.
- `create_sample_data` and `delete_sample_data` for demo database management.

Remaining ideas:

- Deal value suggestions from LLM paths should remain suggestions until user
  confirmation.
- Confirmation strictness may eventually become configurable by user mode.

### M5 - Trend Analysis

Completed:

- `analytics_snapshots` foundation.
- Non-blocking snapshot writes from create/add-meeting/update-stage.
- Idempotent snapshot events.
- `get_metrics(metric_type="pipeline_trend")`.
- `export_report(report_type="pipeline_trend")`.
- Pipeline Trend Review Atlas chart specs.

### M6 - Customer Themes

Completed:

- `get_customer_theme_breakdown`.
- `get_customer_theme_evidence`.
- Customer Themes Review Atlas dashboard specs.

Deferred:

- Human-readable Customer Themes CSV.
- Stronger taxonomy cleanup around industry versus maturity/stage.

### Z1-Z4 - Zero-Config Sample Mode

Completed:

- Storage backend contract.
- Bundled fictional sample fixture.
- `LocalSampleClient`.
- Startup diagnostics and `storage-status`.

Local sample mode is intentionally read-only for the first MVP.

### Z5 - Config Profiles

Completed:

- `sample`, `full`, and `pro` profile definitions.
- `deal-intel config profiles`.
- `deal-intel config show`.

Remaining work is tracked in the current active stream above.
