# MCP Tool Surfaces

English is the source language for this document. Korean summaries belong only
in `README.ko.md` and `AGENTS.ko.md`.

## Goal

Tool surfaces keep the MCP tool list understandable for non-developers while
preserving the full internal development toolbox.

The source contract lives in `src/deal_intel/tool_surfaces.py`.

## Mental Model

- `sample`: a zero-config, bundled, limited feature-test surface with safe
  local personal deal and recruiting tools, plus optional LLM-backed note
  intake for user-created local deals. User-memory tools are included because
  they only read/write constrained local Markdown files.
- `standard`: the normal operator surface for real team data.
- `developer`: everything, including demo seeding and internal QA helpers.

The rule of thumb is: a first-time user should not see tools that require
MongoDB, paid APIs, embeddings, or dangerous data mutation before they have
successfully tried the sample experience. The team/shared product is still
designed around MongoDB-backed real data; `sample` is the low-friction test path
and future local personal path.

## Surface Contract

| Surface | Default Profiles | Purpose | Tool Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sample` | `sample` | Let a new user or AI agent test useful questions and small local personal datasets with no setup | Mostly LLM-free tools that work against bundled sample data, local personal `deals.json`, or local personal `recruiting.json`, plus `add_interaction` when the configured LLM provider is ready |
| `standard` | `full`, `pro`, `custom` | Real operating mode for teams using MongoDB-backed data | User-facing core, admin, analysis, semantic search, and reporting tools |
| `developer` | none by default | Maintainer/debug mode | Every MCP tool, including sample-data seeding helpers |

## Sample Surface

`sample` intentionally contains only tools that should work in local sample mode
without MongoDB today. It is not the full operating surface:

- `config_doctor`
- `get_tool_catalog`
- `update_config`
- `create_deal`
- `add_interaction`
- `update_stage`
- `update_deal`
- `archive_deal`
- `restore_deal`
- `delete_deal`
- `create_candidate`
- `create_client_company`
- `create_position`
- `add_recruiting_interaction`
- `create_submission`
- `add_client_feedback`
- `recommend_candidates_for_position`
- `recommend_positions_for_candidate`
- `get_recruiting_metrics`
- `export_recruiting_report`
- `migrate_local_data`
- `get_deal`
- `list_deals`
- `get_metrics`
- `get_deal_gaps`
- `get_deal_review`
- `get_usage`
- `export_report`
- `export_data`
- `get_user_memory`
- `record_user_memory`
- `get_customer_themes`
- `get_customer_theme_breakdown`
- `get_customer_theme_evidence`

Why this matters:

- `create_deal`, `update_stage`, `update_deal`, `archive_deal`,
  `restore_deal`, and `delete_deal` now persist through local personal storage
  and keep their existing confirmation/dry-run safety gates.
- `add_interaction` is the source-aware intake path for email threads, user
  interviews, call summaries, internal notes, meeting notes
  (`interaction_type: meeting`), and config-registered custom types. It writes
  canonical `deal.interactions` records and keeps outbound/internal-only
  content out of MEDDPICC scoring by default. It caps content and skips exact
  duplicate content before LLM calls unless explicitly overridden. Local sample
  mode skips embedding storage, stores canonical interaction content for
  user-created local personal deals, and keeps list/BI/report paths free of raw
  content, contacts, and vectors.
- `migrate_local_data` is visible in `sample` so a user can graduate local
  personal deals to MongoDB after connecting a URI. It is dry-run-first and
  never migrates bundled fixture records.
- Recruiting tools are visible in `sample` because they are deterministic and
  persist only local personal records under `recruiting.json`. They do not call
  LLMs, embeddings, Atlas Vector Search, or MongoDB in sample mode.
- `get_user_memory` and `record_user_memory` support user-owned operating
  notes under `user_docs/` or configured `user_memory.dir`; writes are
  constrained to safe Markdown slugs and reject secret-shaped content.
- `search_deals` currently needs Mongo-backed embeddings or Atlas Vector Search.
- `get_deal` is a safe detail read; raw notes, raw interaction content,
  contacts, and vectors are excluded from normal surfaces.
- `analyze_deal` calls an LLM for optional strategy preview by default, caches
  repeated calls briefly, and persists strategy output only after explicit
  confirmation.
- `create_sample_data` and `delete_sample_data` manage an Atlas demo database,
  not the bundled zero-config local sample dataset. The current demo dataset
  contains 22 fictional generated deals and is never auto-seeded into the
  primary `full` database.
- `get_insights` still includes legacy Mongo aggregation paths outside
  `pipeline_overview`; sample mode should prefer shared metric/theme surfaces
  that use the local sample read contract.
- `backfill_qualification` and `backfill_qualification_reextract` are real-data
  maintenance tools for framework migrations. They are hidden from `sample`
  because sample mode should not start with historical admin/backfill choices.

## Standard Surface

`standard` is the real operating surface. It includes:

- setup diagnostics,
- core create/read/update flows,
- lifecycle admin tools such as archive/restore/delete,
- BI/reporting tools,
- customer-theme tools,
- semantic search,
- LLM deal analysis,
- qualification framework backfill tools.

`delete_deal` remains a standard admin tool because real operators need a
cleanup path. Safety is enforced by the tool contract itself: dry-run defaults,
exact company match, explicit confirmation, and archived-deal requirement.

`backfill_qualification` and `backfill_qualification_reextract` are standard
admin tools because framework changes are operator-facing. They remain
dry-run-first; only `backfill_qualification_reextract` can call LLMs, and only
in confirmed apply mode.

`create_sample_data` and `delete_sample_data` are excluded from `standard`
because they are demo-database maintenance helpers. They are useful, but they
make the default real-data tool list noisier.

## Developer Surface

`developer` includes every MCP tool. It is for maintainers, testing, fixture
management, and local debugging. Future release work can expose this through
explicit config such as `tools.surface: developer`.

`add_meeting` remains registered only on this surface as a deprecated
compatibility alias for `add_interaction` with `interaction_type: meeting`.
`get_deal_raw` is also developer-only and requires explicit raw-access
confirmation, a reason, and the raw include flag; embeddings remain excluded.
New documentation, examples, and integrations should not depend on it.

## Runtime Filtering

Runtime MCP exposure is now config-driven:

```yaml
tools:
  surface: auto   # auto | sample | standard | developer
```

Behavior:

- `auto` resolves from the effective profile.
- `sample` profile exposes the `sample` surface.
- `full`, `pro`, and `custom` profiles expose the `standard` surface.
- `developer` exposes every registered tool.
- Invalid `tools.surface` config leaves only `config_doctor` and
  `update_config` visible so the server can explain and repair safe
  non-secret configuration problems.

Current exposed counts:

- `sample`: 34 tools
- `standard`: 48 tools
- `developer`: 52 tools

Implementation notes:

- The server registers all Python handlers internally, then filters
  `list_tools()` and blocks hidden `call_tool()` requests by surface.
- This keeps developer tests and direct module imports stable while making the
  MCP client-facing tool list non-developer friendly.
- Some host apps show only a few top matches from their own tool search. This
  is not necessarily a server loading failure; call `get_tool_catalog` to see
  the complete current surface.
- `RECRUIT_AI_TOOLS_SURFACE` can override the configured surface for smoke
  tests or packaged installs. `DEAL_INTEL_TOOLS_SURFACE` remains a
  compatibility fallback for older bundles.
