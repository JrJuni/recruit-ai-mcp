# Storage Backends

This document records the storage contract for the MongoDB-free zero-config
sample and local-personal modes.

## Goal

The team/shared production backend remains MongoDB Atlas. The local sample
backend is a separate zero-config experience for demos, friend reviews, agent
smoke tests, and future lightweight personal use when `MONGODB_URI`, Atlas
Charts, paid API keys, and Atlas Vector Search are not available.

The first sample-mode milestone was intentionally read-only. It proved that the
core BI and deal-review read paths can run over bundled fixture data. Sample
mode now also supports a small mutable local personal dataset for users who want
to try their own data before MongoDB.

## Backend Kinds

| Backend | Purpose | Persistence | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mongo_full` | Production and real demos backed by Atlas | MongoDB Atlas | Full read/write/admin surface |
| `local_sample_mvp` | Zero-config sample experience | Bundled/local fixture data | Read-first BI/review/report surface |
| `local_personal` | Personal trial mode | Local resettable user data file | Safe create/update/stage/lifecycle surface plus LLM-backed note intake when configured |

Runtime config uses:

```yaml
storage:
  backend: mongo        # mongo | local_sample
```

`RECRUIT_AI_STORAGE_BACKEND=local_sample` can be used for temporary smoke
tests without editing user config. `DEAL_INTEL_STORAGE_BACKEND` remains a
compatibility fallback for older bundles.

Local personal storage should default to:

```yaml
storage:
  local_data_dir: ~/.recruit-ai/local-data
```

Users can override this directory through config tools before mutable local
storage writes any data.

## Local Sample MVP Contract

The code contract lives in `src/deal_intel/storage/backend.py`.

`local_sample_mvp` must implement:

| Method | Consumers | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ping()` | startup diagnostics, zero-config smoke | Should not require network access |
| `get_deal(deal_id)` | `get_deal` | Returns one safe sample deal |
| `list_deals(stage=None, limit=50)` | `list_deals` | Supports stage filter and limit |
| `list_deals_for_metrics()` | `get_metrics`, `get_deal_gaps`, `get_deal_review`, customer theme tools, weekly report, `export_data`, natural question smoke | Primary deterministic BI/read/export path; excludes legacy raw notes, canonical raw content, contacts, and vectors |
| `list_analytics_snapshots(start_date, end_date, stage=None, industry=None)` | `pipeline_trend`, trend report | Returns bundled fixture snapshots for sample mode |

This contract supports the first zero-config read stack:

- `list_deals`
- `get_deal`
- `get_metrics(metric_type="pipeline_health")`
- `get_metrics(metric_type="pipeline_trend")` with sparse-history warnings
- `get_deal_gaps`
- `get_deal_review`
- `get_customer_themes`
- `get_customer_theme_breakdown`
- `get_customer_theme_evidence`
- `export_report(report_type="weekly_pipeline")`
- `export_report(report_type="pipeline_trend")`
- `export_data(dataset="open_deals")`
- `export_data(dataset="all_deals")`
- `export_data(dataset="closed_deals")`
- `smoke-natural-questions`

## Local Personal Contract

Local personal storage adds enough persistence for a user to try their own
small dataset without MongoDB. Implemented methods:

- `upsert_deal` (implemented for local personal `deals.json`)
- `insert_delete_audit_log` (implemented for local personal
  `delete_audit_logs.json`)
- `hard_delete_deal` (implemented for local personal `deals.json`)

Supported safe mutation tools:

- `create_deal` (supported by local personal `upsert_deal`)
- `add_interaction` (supported by local personal `upsert_deal`; requires a
  ready LLM provider, stores source metadata, skips embeddings in local sample
  mode, and persists canonical raw interaction content)
- `update_stage` (supported by local personal `upsert_deal`)
- `update_deal` (supported by local personal `upsert_deal`)
- `archive_deal` (supported by local personal `upsert_deal`)
- `restore_deal` (supported by local personal `upsert_deal`)
- `delete_deal` (supported by local personal audit + hard delete)

This target still defers heavier analysis and semantic-search paths until their
runtime requirements are clear:

- `analyze_deal`
- `search_deals`

Reset/export behavior must be explicit before local personal writes ship:

- Local data lives under `storage.local_data_dir`.
- `recruit-ai local-data status` displays the resolved directory and counts.
- `recruit-ai local-data export` writes a secret-safe JSON snapshot.
- `recruit-ai local-data reset` is dry-run by default.
- `recruit-ai local-data reset --force` clears local personal deals and
  recruiting records.
- Local delete audit logs are retained after reset.
- Local personal deal and recruiting data to MongoDB migration is available through
  `migrate_local_data` and `recruit-ai local-data migrate-to-mongo`.

Active read policy:

- When no user-created local deals exist, read paths use the bundled fixture.
- When at least one user-created local deal exists, read paths use only local
  personal deals.
- The bundled fixture remains immutable and archived in the package; it is not
  mixed into the working dataset after local personal data exists.
- `get_deal` should not find bundled fixture deal ids while local personal
  deals are active.
- Pipeline trend fixture snapshots are also hidden while local personal deals
  are active until local personal snapshots are implemented.

Implemented write policy:

- `LocalPersonalStore` writes `deals.json` and `recruiting.json` with schema
  version and dataset metadata.
- Writes strip legacy `raw_notes`, `contacts`, and `summary_embedding` before
  persistence. Canonical `interactions.raw_content` is retained in local
  personal storage so future redaction/security modules can process it.
- `create_deal`, `update_stage`, and `update_deal` can persist through
  `LocalSampleClient.upsert_deal`.
- `add_interaction` persists canonical interactions with summaries, source
  metadata, raw content, MEDDPICC signals, and customer themes for
  user-created local deals, including meeting notes via
  `interaction_type: meeting`. Outbound and internal-only content is stored as
  unconfirmed interaction evidence and does not update the scoring snapshot by
  default. Local sample mode does not initialize or store embeddings.
- `archive_deal` and `restore_deal` can persist through
  `LocalSampleClient.upsert_deal`.
- `delete_deal` writes an audit entry to `delete_audit_logs.json` before
  removing a local personal deal from `deals.json`.
- Safe non-LLM recruiting tools persist candidates, client companies,
  positions, submissions, feedback, recruiting interactions, and saved
  recommendation runs to `recruiting.json`.
- Local recruiting interaction persistence strips `raw_content`; summaries and
  metadata remain available for recommendations, metrics, and reports.
- Delete audit logs are preserved independently from `deals.json` and should
  not be removed by future local reset unless the user explicitly asks for an
  audit reset.
- `local-data reset --force` writes empty `deals.json` and `recruiting.json`.
  Empty local deals keep the bundled fixture archived instead of re-mixing
  fictional data into active deal reads.
- `local-data export` includes local personal deals, recruiting records, and
  delete audit logs, but not legacy raw notes, contacts, embeddings, or
  recruiting raw content. Canonical raw content may be present in local deal
  details.
- Bundled fixture deal ids are read-only and cannot be promoted into local
  personal storage through lifecycle writes.
- Bundled fixture deal ids are also read-only for `add_interaction`; users
  should create their own local deal before adding notes or interactions.
- Analytics snapshot writes are still deferred, so these local writes do not
  yet create local trend snapshots.

## Still Deferred From Local Sample

The sample/local-personal backend does not need to implement:

- Mongo aggregation compatibility: `aggregate_deals`,
  `aggregate_analytics_snapshots`
- Legacy aggregate-heavy tools: non-`pipeline_overview` `get_insights` query
  types
- Semantic/vector search: `get_deals_for_search`, `search_by_embedding`
- Atlas demo database writes: `upsert_deals`, `delete_sample_deals`
- Admin paths: `ensure_indexes`, `ensure_vector_index`

Those paths are not required for lightweight personal use.

## Local To Mongo Migration

Local personal deal and recruiting writes can now graduate to MongoDB-backed
`full` mode through a dry-run-first migration path.

Behavior:

- Dry-run by default.
- Never migrate bundled fictional fixture records.
- Read only user-created records from `storage.local_data_dir/deals.json` and
  `storage.local_data_dir/recruiting.json`.
- Require target MongoDB readiness before classifying rows.
- Require explicit confirmation before any Mongo write.
- Preserve source deal and recruiting record ids where possible.
- Skip existing target deal and recruiting ids by default.
- Overwrite existing target deal and recruiting ids only when `overwrite=true`.
- Return create, overwrite, skipped, and written counts.
- Keep local delete audit logs local; they are not migrated by this command.

CLI:

```bash
recruit-ai local-data migrate-to-mongo
recruit-ai local-data migrate-to-mongo --apply
recruit-ai local-data migrate-to-mongo --apply --overwrite
```

If the source local personal store has zero deals and zero recruiting records
and the command is a dry-run, the migration returns an empty no-write preview
without pinging MongoDB. This keeps the zero-config first-run path fast and
avoids network timeouts before a user has anything to migrate. Once local
records exist, dry-run still checks the target so it can classify
create/overwrite/skip actions.

Non-goals:

- No automatic background sync.
- No two-way sync.
- No migration from MongoDB back into local personal storage.

## Privacy Contract

The local sample backend should preserve the same safe read posture as
`MongoDBClient.list_deals_for_metrics()`:

- no `meetings.raw_notes`
- no `interactions.raw_content`
- no `contacts`
- no `summary_embedding`

Fixture data may include curated meeting summaries, source-aware interaction
metadata, and customer-theme evidence, but not raw notes, raw interaction
content, or private contacts.

## Bundled Zero-Config Fixture

Z2 adds the bundled fixture in
`src/deal_intel/storage/local_sample_fixture.py`.

It provides:

- `load_zero_config_sample_deals()`
- `load_zero_config_sample_snapshots()`
- `build_zero_config_sample_summary()`
- `validate_zero_config_sample_fixture()`

Fixture contract:

- dataset: `zero_config_sample`
- version: `2026-06-10.v1`
- as-of date: `2026-06-10`
- trend window start: `2026-06-03`
- at least 10 fictional deals
- all canonical stages represented:
  `discovery`, `qualification`, `proposal`, `negotiation`, `stalled`,
  `won`, `lost`
- all deal value statuses represented:
  `unknown`, `rough_estimate`, `customer_budget`, `quoted`,
  `strategic_zero`
- curated meeting summaries, source-aware interaction metadata, and
  customer-theme evidence included
- trend snapshots included for a 7-day pipeline movement smoke
- no `meetings.raw_notes`, `interactions.raw_content`, `contacts`, or
  `summary_embedding`

The fixture remains immutable. Future local personal data should be stored as a
separate resettable overlay rather than mutating the bundled fixture.

## LocalSampleClient

Z3 adds `src/deal_intel/storage/local_sample.py`.

`LocalSampleClient` wraps the bundled fixture and satisfies the
`local_sample_mvp` read contract:

- `ping()`
- `get_deal(deal_id)`
- `list_deals(stage=None, limit=50)`
- `list_deals_for_metrics()`
- `list_analytics_snapshots(start_date, end_date, stage=None, industry=None)`

When `storage.backend` is `local_sample`, `_context.mongo()` returns this local
backend instead of `MongoDBClient`. The existing function name is kept for tool
compatibility, but the runtime behavior is now storage-backend selection rather
than Mongo-only construction.

Local sample mode skips Mongo driver preload, Mongo index creation, and
embedding warmup at MCP startup. `search_deals` returns a structured
unsupported-mode response before touching the embedding provider because
semantic search is outside the current sample MVP.

## Startup Diagnostics And Quickstart

Z4 adds explicit user-facing diagnostics for MongoDB-free startup.

When `storage.backend` is `mongo` and `MONGODB_URI` is missing,
`MongoDBClient.ping()` now returns:

- `status: missing_uri`
- `storage_backend: mongo`
- the configured database name
- a message explaining that Atlas-backed storage needs `MONGODB_URI`
- a `sample_mode_hint` with the temporary env var and persistent config shape

The same hint is used by the missing-URI runtime error so MCP startup or CLI
smoke failures point users toward the sample path instead of failing silently.

The new CLI command is:

```powershell
& "$HOME\miniconda3\envs\deal-intel\python.exe" -m deal_intel.cli storage-status
```

Temporary sample mode:

```powershell
$env:RECRUIT_AI_STORAGE_BACKEND='local_sample'
```

Persistent sample mode:

```yaml
storage:
  backend: local_sample
```

`storage-status --json` is intended for installer checks and agent smoke tests.
It exits with code `1` when Mongo storage is selected but not ready, and exits
with code `0` in local sample mode.

## Verification

Current contract checks:

- `tests/test_storage_backend_contract.py`
- `tests/test_zero_config_sample_fixture.py`
- `tests/test_storage_diagnostics.py`
- `SampleReadStorageBackend` runtime protocol
- `backend_capability_report(...)`
- `validate_backend_capabilities(...)`

Next local-sample work should focus on mutable/resettable local personal state,
not on expanding the production Mongo path.
